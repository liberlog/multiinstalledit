cd/dvd and USB stick menu system for software, games, music, video, etc (Linux port of Multi install for Windows http://multiinstall.sourceforge.net/descr.html )
First we have to translate the Pascal/Delphi code to Lazarus code.
Then we shall try to compile for Linux, and solve the differents appearing problems.

It should be portable to Mac OSX also (and we hope more)
